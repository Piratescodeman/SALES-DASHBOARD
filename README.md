## üìù Problem Statement

**AtliQ Hardware** is a company that delivers computer hardware and peripheral products to clients through several branches across India. The Sales Director faces challenges in understanding the business performance as sales are not meeting expectations and are gradually declining.  
The Sales Director also struggles to get real-time updates from regional managers since they are not comfortable analyzing numbers directly from Excel files.
